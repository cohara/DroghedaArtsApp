		<p>
Roll up, roll up, step right up
and receive a warm welcome
into the world of high brow
entertainment.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, witness the antics of one
charming, charismatic buffoon...
Sir Edwin Longbottom comes
direct from the world of
vaudeville with his world famous
football act. Dazzling dexterity
is displayed as four footballs are
bounced and balanced around his
body. There's just one problem,
Edwin has a stage to set except
he never trained for this. In his
day, there was always somebody
else to do it.
Nimble versus clumsy; charismatic
athlete versus clownish buffoon.
You never know which side
emerges on top with Edwin
around.

<p>Kenneth Fall , Star Man : The Circus Years</p>
<br>
<p> <h2> <img src="ArtsImages/ArtsImages_Page_11_Image_0001.jpg"/> </h2> </p>
	<p>
For years man has looked tothe
heavens for inspiration and
guidance. But now the heavens
have come to them. Star Man, a
heavenly mix of circus, comedy and
cardboard.
Ken was raised in the grubby Dublin
suburb town of Balbriggan. He
entered the world of entertainment at
a very early age. By the time he was
13, he was watching at least 7 hours
of television a night. After travelling
through Europe with his juggling
equipment he returned to Ireland
and set up Tumble Circus in 1998.
Tumble Circus has grown into the
Ireland's most successful circus
street theatre company. As well as
performing, Ken writes and directs
most of the company's work. Star
Man is Ken's first solo show.
