	<h2> St Peter's Church of Ireland </h2>

	Built on the site of an earlier church, St Peters is a wonderful example of a Georgian church. With its cut-
	stone facade and rich rococo plasterwork It has been described as “probably the finest provincial 
	Georgian church in Ireland”. The present interior of the Church is largely the result of a major reordering 
	in the late 19th century which forms a great preaching box which not only provides great acoustics for 
	the voice but also for orchestras which use the church for classical concerts. The original box pews were 
	removed and the present rows of pews installed in their place and the sanctuary area was reordered in 
	1907 and the present pulpit and prayer desk installed circa 1909. The organ, for which the Corporation 
	of Drogheda gave £300 in 1771, was built for the Church by John Snetzler in London.

	Within the churchyard of St. Peter’s can be found many interesting and varied funerary monuments. Of 
	these, perhaps the most interesting and visited is a “cadaver stone” taken from the tomb of Sir Edmond 
	Goldyng and his wife Elizabeth Fleming. It is built into the churchyard wall, east of the present building 
	and shows two cadavers enclosed in shrouds which have been partially opened to show the remains of 
	the occupants of the tomb. The tomb dates from the first quarter of the 16th century.

	A fine tombstone also stands over the grave of John Duggan, a Drogheda man who as a private in the 
	17th Lancers fought in the Crimean campaign. He was a survivor of the Charge of the Light Brigade at 
	Balaklava and the battles of Alma and Sevastopol. Duggan was, on his discharge from the Army, 
	employed as Sexton in St. Peter’s where he served from c1873 until his death in 1881.
