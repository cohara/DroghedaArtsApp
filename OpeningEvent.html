There are many kinds of spaces, both
physical and metaphysical, that artists play
with in their work, and many spaces that we,
as humans inhabit. However, perhaps the
most familiar space, the one that has been
the stimulus for much artistic enquiry, be it
visual or otherwise, has been the domestic,
or home space, as that is where our earliest
and most formative experiences are shaped.
	</p>
	
	<p>
This exhibition takes as its root the
domestic in all its simple complexities and
contradictions, to ask what facts and fictions the
domestic suggests to the artist and viewer today.
Beginning with works that allude to the domestic
within the Drogheda Municipal Art Collection,
these have acted as pinpoints in which to thread
contemporary works to create new ways of
looking and experiencing the domestic in art and
life.

	<p>
In bringing together three different voices: Aoife
Ruane, the director of the gallery; Amanda
Coogan an artist and Jane Humphries an art
historian/writer, their individual concerns
have been creatively challenged to
renegotiate the preconceived ideas that
the domestic presents as a contained, safe,
familiar concept. Literally, from discussions
around a domestic kitchen table, these three
voices have shared their ideas, knowledge
and experiences.
