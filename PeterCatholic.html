	Visitors to Drogheda Town won’t want to miss St Peter’s 
	Roman Catholic Church, constructed using local limestone 
	in 1884. The site previously housed a church built in 1791 
	and parts of that structure were incorporated into the present 
	building, which boasts an impressive Gothic architectural 
	style. Inside, visitors can view fine sculptures, a spectacular 
	marble High Altar and more than 40 stained glass windows.

	The church is also famous for housing the shrine of St Oliver 
	Plunkett, who is credited with bringing Jesuits to Drogheda. 
	He was hanged for treason in 1681. Pope Paul VI declared 
	him a saint in 1973, and his preserved head forms the 
	centrepiece of the shrine.
